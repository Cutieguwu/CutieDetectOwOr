# DetectOwOr

## Cutieguwu's basic virus and malware scanner.

**In very early development!!!**

**NOTICE:** As I am busy doing exams and summatives, this project is getting put on hold until further notice.

### At present DetecOwOr will support basic detection of the following:

- Fractureiser {Files}
- Skyrage {Files}

### Future plans:

- The detector will later be able to pull information on detecting new malicious programs via a repository. I hope. That will likely not ever come to fruition, but who knows.
	-  By extension, at the very least, the library that is currently hard-coded into the script will be moved to an external file and read from there.
- SHA checks. This will hopefully allow detection of, for example, Minecraft mods that are known to be infected with Fractureiser. Linux and MultiMC users will get priority for support over Windows and the base launcher.
